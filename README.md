Arduino-Sensor
==============

Library for a few common I2C sensors for the Arduino

Usage
-----

Go to your Arduino Library folder, and clone this repository into it:

	git clone https://github.com/mganger/arduino-sensor

Then use it like a library.

If you use ino, clone it into the lib folder of you project. You should have a
directory tree like:

	lib
	 |__ arduino-sensor
	                |__ Accel.h
	                |__ Gyro.h
	                |__ Magnet.h
	                |__ Pressure.h

And other files. Just `#include` them like you would any other file
